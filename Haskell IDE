EclipseFP plugin for Eclipse IDE

Eclipse is an open, extensible IDE platform for "everything and nothing in particular". It is implemented in Java and runs
on several platforms. The Java IDE built on top of it has already become very popular among Java developers. 
The Haskell tools extend it to support editing (syntax coloring, code assist), compiling, and running Haskell programs from
within the IDE. In more details, it features:

Syntax highlighting and errors/warning highlighting

A module browser showing all installed packages, their modules and the contents of the modules (functions, types, etc.)

Integration with Hoogle: select an identifier in your code, press F4 and see the results in hoogle

Code navigation: from within a Haskell source file, jump to the file where a symbol in declared, 
or everywhere a symbol is used (type sensitive search, not just a text search)

Outline view: quickly jump to definitions in your file

Quick fixes on common errors and import management

A cabal file editor and integration with Cabal (uses cabal configure, cabal build under the covers), and
a graphical view of installed packages

Integration with GHCi: launch GHCi inside Eclipse on any module

Integration with the GHCi debugger: performs the GHCi debugging commands for you from the standard Eclipse debugging interface

Integration with HLint: gives you HLint warning on building and allows you to quick fix them

Integration with Stylish-Haskell: format your code with stylish-haskell

Test support: shows results of test-framework based test suite in a graphical format. HTF support to come soon.
